### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I am a husband and father of five.
- My mission is to bring Industrial automation and Information technologies together.
- I work on a few projects, some OSS like [IX](https://github.com/ix-ax), [TcOpen](https://github.com/TcOpenGroup/TcOpen)
- I am fluent in the following languages: Slovak, C#, English, Python, Italian, any of IEC-61131-3
- I am somewhat knowledgeable in Spanish, C, C++, Russian, F#
- I can kind of understand: Estonian, Go, Polish, JavaScript, Czech, Java
- In the field of industrial automation, I master Siemens, Beckhoff, Schneider, Rexroth.
- My preferred pronoun in the third person singular is *he*, sometimes, I refer to myself as *we*, and you may refer to me as *they* since my work often includes the work of many of my friends and coworkers.
